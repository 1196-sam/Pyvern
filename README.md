Hello! 
This is a project by 1144oli and 1196-sam. Which is a lan chat made entirely in python.
It uses a server and client model although peer to peer is in the works. If port forwarded this can be a web chat, although we suggest using it as just a lan chat for now.

# Usage
Usage has been made as easy as possible. Simply download the setup.py and nohting else. Python3 is required for this project to work with PIP installed as the package manager.
1) Download Setup.py to a newly made Folder.
2) Run in the directory
```
python3 setup.py
```
3) Follow the setup procedure.
4) Configure server and client to your best wishes this is done in config.json and userconfig.json respectively. There are 50 max connections by default. 
6) Use chat.py to connect on a client.
