add headers to message content so legacy messages will be compatible with later updates
as they can still be identified even if their format does not match the new messages
for example
version 1
username:"bobmarley",message_text:"hello world",datetime:"2023,april,12"
version 3
user_hash:"b0bmar1ey",permissions:"admin",message_text:"hello world",datetime:"2023,april,12"
